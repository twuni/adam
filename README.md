# Adam

> ⚠️  This is **pre-release** software and is NOT YET ready for production use.

Adam is a reimplementation of the [Atom][1] text editor.

## Why?

Atom has been officially abandoned and its codebase has been rotting for the past two years.
Rather than attempt to repair it, I intend to learn from it and reimplement Atom's elegant
design in such a way that what I have grown to love about it can still flourish and remain
accessible to developers for years to come.
